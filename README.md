	- More correctly implemented sceAtrac-through-sceSas functionality, fixing voice in Sol Trigger and multiple minis ([#20156])
	- Better support for using sceAudiocodec directly, fixing music in some homebrew apps ([#20199], [#20246], [#20253], [#20209])
	- Volume control improvement ([#19969], [#19971])

- Rendering fixes and performance
    - Important: This will be the last major version with D3D9 support. D3D11 will of course continue to be supported, along with Vulkan and OpenGL.
	- Fix smoke effects in Jak'n'Daxter by re-using the fix from Ratchet & Clank ([#20032])
    - Software depth buffer rendering added to fix lens flares in multiple games efficiently (Midnight Club LA, Wipeout, Syphon Filter etc) ([#19748], [#19764], [#20231], [#19955], etc)
	- Multiple rendering-related crash fixes ([#20270], [#20346], [#20344])

- General emulation
	- Allow disabling HLE on a per-module basis (if games ship the module so we can load it). Enabled for sceCcc ([#20218]), and more importantly scePsmf ([#20208]), fixing multiple issues.
	- Additional module loading improvements ([#20114])
	- More precise sleep function on Windows ([#20054])
	- More replacement texture improvements, allow replacing game icons ([#19975], [#19978])

- Control and input
	- Touch gliding support added ([#19983])
	- Allow simultaneous DInput and XInput input ([#20347])

- New "Dear ImGui"-based PSP debugger: ImDebugger
	- Allows very rapid development of debugging features as-needed, and also implements a pretty good Ge debugger for stepping through draws.
	- Unlike the old Win32 debugger (but similar to the unmaintained web debugger), works on all platforms (though cumbersome on touchscreens)
	- Major commits (though there are many more): ([#20242], [#20240], [#20294])

- Multiplayer
	- Added Infrastructure multiplayer support, with automatic DNS configuration ([#19865], [#19869], [#20221], [#20220], [#19875])
	    - Note: Only games that people have made "revival servers" for will work. See [here](https://www.ppsspp.org/docs/multiplayer/infrastructure-servers/).
	- Implement more of sceNet (prerequisite for the former feature).
	- Socket re-mapping implemented ([#19827])
	- Assorted bugfixes, thanks ANR2ME ([#20247], [#20245], [#19843], [#19849], [#19836])

- UI
	- Loading spinner now actually spins properly, the app no longer appears to hang ([#20341])
	- Minor features: Asks for confirmation on exit in most scenarios ([#19996], [#20023]), DPI scaling ([#20013]), can pause without menu ([#19883])
	- As usual a lot of tweaks, perf fixes, and fixes for hangs and crashes ([#20343], [#20332], [#20305], [#20303], [#20299], [#20163], [#20152], [#20143], [#20079], [#20137], [#20374])

	- Support displaying the battery percentage on more platforms ([#19973], [#19967])
	- Allow picking a background image on iOS ([#20370])
